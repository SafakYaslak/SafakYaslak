###  About Me

I am a senior student in the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at Izmir Katip Çelebi University. I am a developer passionate about autonomous systems, robotic manipulation, and AI-based image processing. I focus on transforming the theoretical and practical experience I gained from TÜBİTAK and TEKNOFEST projects into professional solutions.

*  I'm currently working on **Autonomous Underwater Systems and Manipulators**.
*  I'm deepening my competencies in **Deep Learning** and **Embedded Systems**.
