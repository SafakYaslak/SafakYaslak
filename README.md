Hello! 👋 I'm Şafak Yaslak.

I'm a developer who is interested in technology and innovations. I'm motivated by solving problems in the fields of computer vision, image processing and artificial intelligence and developing user-friendly applications in these fields.

I actively use the Python language and enjoy developing projects with various libraries in this ecosystem (such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask). At the same time, I'm also interested in web technologies (such as HTML, React) to bring my ideas to life.

I believe that the learning process continues throughout life and I try to follow innovations in the rapidly developing fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning closely.

If you want to discuss new ideas, potential collaborations or just chat about technology, don't hesitate to contact me!
